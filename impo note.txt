8️⃣ HTTP Status Codes (VERY IMPORTANT)
Code	Meaning
200	Success
201	Created
400	Bad request
401	Unauthorized (bad API key)
403	Forbidden
404	Not found
500	Server error



How Developers Handle API Limits
✅ 1. Reduce requests

Request only needed fields

Use batch endpoints

✅ 2. Cache results

Store API responses locally:

Database

File (JSON/CSV)

✅ 3. Use pagination smartly

Stop when enough data is collected.

✅ 4. Handle errors properly
if response.status_code == 429:
    time.sleep(60)

✅ 5. Monitor usage

Most APIs provide dashboards.

🚫 What Happens If You Ignore Limits?

Requests start failing

API key suspended

Account blocked

Unexpected costs

⭐ Beginner Golden Rules

✔ Read the API docs
✔ Track quotas
✔ Use .env for keys
✔ Handle errors
✔ Cache data

🎯 For Your Learning Path

Since you’re learning APIs + YouTube, next I recommend:

Quota-friendly YouTube requests

Pagination (plitting large amounts of data into smaller pages instead of sending everything at once) handling

Retry & backoff strategies

Saving API data to CSV / DB

way forward:
- create github repo for the project.(.gitignore used to ignore unneded file (created  environment), hide .env which contains sensitive info  )
- python scripts for data extruction.
-Docker folder uder it we put postgres as sub folder then we save in it (init-multiple-database.sh fr initiating multiple database)
-Docker(dockerfile(for installation of specific version of Airflow and python ) )

When a container runs:
Image → provides the app & environment
Volume → stores the data the app creates

-docker compose yaml file used to define and run multiple data base
 
 - create Airflow Dag that will  execute the code (this is usually transformig python code into the way that airflow can understand 
 adding dechorator like @task(for every defined function). here you from (airflow.decorators import task, & from airflow.models import Variable))




folder we needs to create
dags(where we write Dag python code)
logs (logs for task executions)  --not used 
config(customising custom configuration )-- not used
plugins(sensors , customer plugins)
tests(codes for functional test)
data( json data)
include( any aditional file dag can need)





What is Apache Airflow?

Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow orchestration tool.

In simple terms:
It lets you define tasks, decide the order they run, schedule them, and watch them execute.

Think of Airflow as a conductor for data jobs — making sure everything runs at the right time and in the right order 🎼

What problem does Airflow solve?

Imagine you have this daily process:

Pull data from an API

Clean the data

Load it into a database

Run analytics

Send a report



IMPORTANT codes.
*docker compose down :(for stoping the container), it is mainly used is you want to apply bigger change on 
  your docker compose like adding or removing services or changes name volumes  and 
  before switching off your laptop to avoid potential issues like port conflicts or network errors when starting them again.
*docker compose up -d --build:( Rebuild the images, start all containers, 
and keep them running in the background.Apply latest changes and run the app.)
*code of going inside the airflow (docker exec -it airflow-scheduler bash)
